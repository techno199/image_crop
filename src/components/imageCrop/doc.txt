How to properly set up cropper: 
1. Select image in input
2. Use reader to get Width and Height
3. Resize image to match html using given max_height and max_width (604px):
  - Image must have width and height at least of 200px
  - Image aspect ratio must fit following formula: 0.25 < aspect < 3
  - If image is too wide: 
    - resize width while saving aspect ratio
  - If image is too high:
    - resize height while saving aspect ratio
At this point we have ACTUAL Width and Height of IMAGE
4. Build markup using evaluated dimensions
  - When picture was initially horizontal and got rotated
  set uter container with margin: '${widthHeignDiff / 2 + 20} auto'
  - Set inner container dimensions equal to those image has
  - Have a transform: rotate on <img /> element
So far we gotta have right image rendering.
5. Set up croppper area:
  - initially it is right in a middle:
    - For portrait:
      - top = imgHeight - 30/2
      - left = imgWidth - 30/2
      - width = imgWidth - 30
      - height = imgHeight - 30
    - For landscape: 
      - top = imgHeight - 30/2
      - height = imgWidth - 30
      - left = imgWidth / 2 + height
      - width = height * 2
